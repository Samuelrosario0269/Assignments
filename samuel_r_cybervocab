there once was a man named jim.  jim was going around texting people saying that they where from the 
IRS saying that people had a outstanding balence. he went around first texting people tht he was from a company giving
out job applications. so people will put down the information then jim will call back with a diffrent number claiming
to be from the IRS.He would then read the information from the application to convince the people that it was legit because he was saying
there name and address. so people will fall for it and then give them money to pay the "bill" off. so jim gets off with money
and the people thinking that they where just behind on a bill.
